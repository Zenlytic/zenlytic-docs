# Exploring your data 

The explore question lets you answer the "What" question about your data. You can get to this question by [searching your data](./1_using_zenlytic.md#search), [clicking on a metric](./1_using_zenlytic.md#metrics), or [following up from a dashboard](./1_using_zenlytic.md#dashboards).  Once in the explore interface, you can do several operations on your data.

### Slicing 

You can add or remove metrics and slices from your explore whenever you'd like. You use the Metrics and Slices menu on the left hand side to add these additional metrics or slices.

### Filtering 

You can also use the left hand menu to filter on a metric of a slice by clicking the three dot menu and clicking "Add as filter" or you can add a filter by clicking the + button at the bottom of the the filter section.

To set your filter how you want it you can change the comparison by clicking the middle drop down.

To set the value to use for the filter you can use the drop down for the value on the right side of the value.

### Time periods

The time period allows you to filter your data by its primary time slice. You can change the value to a custom range by choosing how you'd like to use the time period.

Then, once you choose how you'd like to define your time period, you choose the values to complete the time period selection, like this.
