# Schedule Delivery

Next to the Run Preview "Play" button, we can click "Schedule Delivery" to open a modal for managing delivery schedules for this Proactive Agent. By default, there will be no schedules, so click "Create New Delivery" to get started.

On this page we have multiple options for configuring our scheduled delivery, such as name, cadence (When and how frequently to send), and destination (Email or Slack). Once the scheduled delivery has been created, we can also edit or delete the scheduled delivery from this form. From the list of scheduled deliveries, we can click "Send a copy now" to test the Proactive Agent delivery at any time.
