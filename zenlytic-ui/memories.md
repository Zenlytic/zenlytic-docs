# Memories

Use memories to teach Zoë about your company, your data preferences, and how you want questions answered. When you give positive feedback in chat, Zoë creates memories to remember your preferences for future conversations.

## How memories work

Give Zoë positive feedback on good answers, and she'll remember your preferences. This makes her responses more accurate and personalized to how you work with your data.

## Create a memory

When Zoë gives you a good answer, click the "thumb up" :thumbsup: button to create a memory. This tells Zoë to remember how you want similar questions answered in the future.

## What memories can't do

Keep these limitations in mind:

* **Data questions only**: Memories work for data interpretation, not personality changes. Use [custom system prompts](../tips-and-tricks/zoe_context_ingestion.md) to modify Zoë's behavior or personality.
* **Positive feedback only**: Memories only learn from thumbs up, not thumbs down. Use [custom system prompts](../tips-and-tricks/zoe_context_ingestion.md) for negative feedback about Zoë's responses.
