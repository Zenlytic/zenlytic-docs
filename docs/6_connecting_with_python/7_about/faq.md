### What if I don't use Looker?

Metrics Layer has a yaml-based metrics definition, which is documented [here](../5_data_model/1_data_model.md). It functions similarly to LookML, but is based on yaml, not a proprietary language. If you're interested in additional features for this data model, email paul at zenlytic.com or open a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/Zenlytic/metrics_layer/issues).
