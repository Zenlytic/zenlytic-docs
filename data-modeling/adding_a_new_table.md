# Adding a New Table

1. Tables can be added by clicking the "Add new table" button in the Data Model Editor.

Clicking the button will bring up the Add New Table modal.

The default tab is "Data Warehouse", which lets you select tables from existing database connections.

Alternatively, file upload is supported for CSVs. Only one table can be selected at a time, and only CSVs can be uploaded.

2. After selecting a table or CSV to upload, table metadata like column data types, topic, and primary key can be selected.

3. If the table joins to other existing tables in the data model, click "Add Joins" to add joins prior to adding the table. Joins can also be set up later.
