# Integrations

The metrics layer (obviously) integrates with [Zenlytic's own data model](../../4_data_modeling/1_data_modeling.md) as a data model and [dbt Metrics](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/building-a-dbt-project/metrics) (example dbt [integration](https://github.com/Zenlytic/jaffle_shop)).

It integrates with BigQuery, Redshift, Postgres, Druid, and Snowflake for data warehouses.
