# Plot Configuration Tips and Tricks with Zoe

## Overview

In this document, you'll find tips and tricks for configuring your plots using natural language commands with Zoë, Zenlytic's AI Analyst. This will help you make the most of the plot settings feature, enabling you to create insightful and visually appealing charts. Here are some common use cases and example prompts to help you get started.

## Best Practices

1. **Be Specific**: Use exact field names and be clear about which elements you want to modify. For example, instead of saying "change the line color," specify "change the 'Revenue' line color to blue."
2. **Use Clear Terminology**: Use standard chart terminology that Zoë can understand. Terms like "axis," "legend," "series," "labels," and "background" work well.
3. **Check for Compatibility**: Some plot configurations may not be available for all chart types. If a command doesn't work, try rephrasing or check if the feature is supported for your current chart type.
