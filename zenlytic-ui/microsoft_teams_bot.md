This guide provides step-by-step instructions for IT teams on how to install the Zenlytic Bot within their organization's Microsoft Teams environment.

* Send your tenant ID to **paul@zenlytic.com** to connect your Zenlytic workspace to your Teams workspace

## Step 2: Access the Microsoft Teams Admin Center

* Navigate to the [Microsoft Teams Admin Center](https://admin.teams.microsoft.com/dashboard) and log in using your admin credentials

Navigate to your **zenlytic\_bot.zip** file, select it and proceed with the upload.

## Step 4: Verify the App Publishing

* Upon successful upload, a confirmation message should appear. If a verification link is provided in the pop-up window, you can use it to directly verify that the app has been published correctly. If no pop-up window appears or you prefer to manually confirm the app's presence, navigate back to "Manage apps" within the Teams Admin Center. Here, search for "Zenlytic" in the app list to ensure it has been published successfully.

## Step 5: Add the Zenlytic Bot to your Team

* Open the Microsoft Teams app, and you should find the Zenlytic app listed under "Apps" in the left-hand menu

* Note that it might take a few hours for the app to become visible in your Teams app after publishing (based on our testing this could be up to 24 hours)
* Click on the Zenlytic app icon, then select "Add". Choose the appropriate team to which you want to add the Zenlytic Bot
