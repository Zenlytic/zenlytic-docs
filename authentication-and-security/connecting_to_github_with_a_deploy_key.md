**Step 2:** Next, find your git repo details (these will be in Github).

Make sure to use the "SSH" format of the git URL. The format looks like `git@github.com:<YOUR_ORGANIZATION>/<YOUR_REPO>.git`, and you can find it here in your Github repo under the "Code" button with the SSH tab as shown below.

**Step 3:** Now that you have that URL and the branch you want to use as your production branch, return to Zenlytic. In this example, we pasted our Github repo url (SSH format) and our production branch, which was: `master`.

**Step 4:** Next we need to generate the SSH key we'll use to connect. Hit the "Generate Deploy Key" button, then the "Confirm" button, and copy the public SSH key generated.
