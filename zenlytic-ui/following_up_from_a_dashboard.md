# Follow Ups From a Dashboard

There are two ways you can follow up from a dashboard question in Zenlytic.

1. Entering an explore interface, where you can select metrics, slices, and filters from a list.
2. Chatting with [Zöe](https://www.zenlytic.com/product), our natural language chatbot.

For both options, select the 3-dot menu in the top right-hand corner of a chart in a dashboard.

You will see both of these options in the hover follow up menu options&#x20;

## Explore from here

This opens a graphical explore where you can change the query, filters or chart using controls in the UI.

## Start a chat with Zöe

Starting a chat with Zoë from here will open a new chat window and set the tile you asked about as context for Zoë.

You can ask Zoë a question about the result to iterate on it with her.
