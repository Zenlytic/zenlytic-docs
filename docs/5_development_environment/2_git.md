# Git (version control)

To start with your Zenlytic data model, you'll need a [GitHub](https://github.com) repo. If you don't already have one, you can create an account and a repo with [GitHub](https://github.com). If you already use dbt, you'll have a GitHub repo already set up, and you can add your Zenlytic data model to that repo.

To create a repo, follow the [instructions on GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/create-a-repo).

Next, to give Zenlytic access to your GitHub repo, you'll need to [create a personal access token](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-server@3.4/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token).

Finally you'll go to the Zenlytic UI and go to the settings page

Once in the settings menu, you'll enter your GitHub information in the Workspace settings section.
