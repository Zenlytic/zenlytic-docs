# Publish

By default, Proactive Agents are private to you, however, we can allow others in our organization to run and extend our Proactive Agents when they are ready. The following image shows the "Publish Proactive Agent" popover that appears after clicking "Publish" in the Proactive Agent Builder Header.

After pressing '+ Add Group', we can select a workspace 'group' and give the group an 'access level' of Viewer, Editor, and Owner. For example, I've given all users in my workspace the ability to View the following Proactive Agent. See the table below for more detail on Proactive Agent access levels.

<table data-header-hidden><thead><tr><th width="312.6796875"></th><th></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Access Level</strong></td><td><strong>Description</strong></td></tr><tr><td>OWNER</td><td>can run, edit, and share the Proactive Agent</td></tr><tr><td>EDITOR</td><td>can run and edit the Proactive Agent, but not share</td></tr><tr><td>VIEWER</td><td>can run the Proactive Agent, but cannot edit or share</td></tr></tbody></table>
