Zenlytic may provide that notice in a variety of ways, including, among other things, sending Customer an email, posting a notice on the Service itself, or by posting the revised Addendum on Zenlytic's website and revising the "last updated" date at the top of this Addendum.

## 1. Nature of Data Processing

The subject matter of the data processing, including the processing operations carried out by Zenlytic on behalf of Customer and Customer's data processing instructions for Zenlytic, will be described in the Agreement, this Addendum, and each statement of work, order form, or equivalent document where Customer orders Services from Zenlytic, which form integral parts of the Agreement.

## 3. Customer Obligations

Customer shall:

### 3.1 Instructions and Purpose

Provide instruction to Zenlytic and determine the purposes and general means of Zenlytic's processing of Personal Data on behalf of Customer under the Agreement; and

### 3.2 Data Protection Compliance

comply with its personal data protection, data security and other obligations prescribed by Data Protection Requirements for Controllers by, without limitation, meeting its obligations under Data Protection Requirements to:

1. establish and maintain a procedure for the exercise of the rights of the individuals whose Personal Data Zenlytic processes on behalf of Customer;
2. as required by Data Protection Requirements, provide notice and obtain consent from the individuals whose Personal Data Zenlytic processes on behalf of Customer;
3. establish or ensure that another party has established a legal basis for Zenlytic's processing of Personal Data contemplated by this Addendum;
4. process only data that have been lawfully and validly collected and ensure that such data will be relevant and proportionate to the respective uses; and
5. ensure compliance with the provisions of this Addendum by its personnel and by any person accessing or using Personal Data on its behalf.

### 3.3 Processing Instructions

By entering into this Addendum, Customer instructs Zenlytic to process Customer Personal Data, in accordance with applicable law: (a) to provide the Services; (b) as authorized by the Agreement, including this Addendum; and (c) as further documented in any other written instructions given by Customer and acknowledged in writing by Zenlytic as constituting instructions for purposes of this Addendum.

## 4. Zenlytic Obligations

### 4.1 Processing Requirements

Zenlytic, in its capacity as a Processor or subprocessor of Personal Data, shall:

1. process Personal Data solely for the purposes of providing the Services as described in the Agreement (which shall encompass the processing authorized by Customer's instructions), and in compliance with the instructions received from Customer and the Agreement;
2. not sell any CA Personal Data or retain, use or disclose CA Personal Data outside of the direct business relationship between Zenlytic and Customer;
3. inform Customer promptly if, in Zenlytic's opinion, an instruction from Customer violates applicable Data Protection Requirements;
4. adopt and maintain appropriate security measures including organizational and technical measures, which will be at least as stringent as those set forth as Exhibit A attached hereto (the "Security Measures"), designed to maintain a level of security appropriate to the risks presented by processing the Personal Data, taking into account the state of the art, the costs of implementation and the nature, scope, context and purposes of processing as well as the risk of varying likelihood and severity for the rights and freedoms of natural persons;
5. grant access to Personal Data only to personnel who need such access for the scope of their job duties, and are subject to appropriate confidentiality arrangements;
6. if it intends to engage one or more third parties acting on its behalf ("subprocessor") to help it to satisfy its obligations in accordance with this Addendum or to delegate all or part of the processing activities to such subprocessors: (i) remain responsible, and liable, to Customer for the subprocessors' acts and omissions with regard to data protection; and (ii) enter into contractual arrangements with such subprocessors requiring them to provide a substantially similar level of data protection compliance and information security to that provided for herein. Subject to the requirements of this Section 4.1(6), Customer hereby generally authorizes the engagement of subprocessors. When any new subprocessor is engaged during the term of the Agreement, Zenlytic will promptly notify Customer of the engagement. If Customer objects to such engagement in a written notice to Zenlytic within 15 days of being informed thereof on reasonable grounds relating to the protection of Personal Data, Zenlytic and Customer will work together in good faith to find a mutually acceptable resolution to address such objection. If the parties are unable to reach a mutually acceptable resolution within a reasonable timeframe, Customer may, as its sole and exclusive remedy, terminate the Agreement for its convenience (without liability to Zenlytic) and cancel the Services by providing written notice to Zenlytic. If Customer does not object to Zenlytic's appointment of a subprocessor during the 15-day period referred to in this Section 4.1(6), Customer shall be deemed to have approved Zenlytic's engagement and ongoing use of that subprocessor.

### 4.2 Information Obligations

Zenlytic shall promptly inform Customer if Zenlytic becomes aware of:

1. any legally binding request for disclosure of Personal Data by a law enforcement authority; or
2. any notice, inquiry or investigation by a Supervisory Authority with respect to Personal Data.

### 4.3 Personal Data Breach Notification

Zenlytic further agrees to notify Customer of any accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure of, or access to Personal Data in Zenlytic's possession, custody or control ("Personal Data Breach") without undue delay and in any event within 72 hours of becoming aware of a Personal Data Breach. Personal Data Breaches do not include unsuccessful attempts or activities that do not compromise the security of Personal Data, including unsuccessful log-in attempts, pings, port scans, denial of service attacks, or other network attacks on firewalls or networked systems.

### 4.4 Customer Assistance

Zenlytic shall reasonably assist Customer regarding:

1. any requests from data subjects in respect of access to or the rectification, erasure, restriction, portability, blocking or deletion of Personal Data. In the event that a data subject sends such a request directly to Zenlytic, Zenlytic will direct the data subject to submit such request to Customer directly, and Customer shall be responsible for responding to such requests. Where relevant, Customer acknowledges and agrees, both generally and specifically for the purpose of Clause 10(a) of Module Three of the EU Standard Contractual Clauses, that there are no circumstances in which it would be appropriate for Zenlytic to notify any third-party controller of any data subject request and that any such notification shall be the Customer's responsibility;
2. the investigation of Personal Data Breaches and the notification to the Supervisory Authority and data subjects in respect of such breaches by providing available details of the Personal Data breaches, including steps Zenlytic has taken to mitigate the potential risks and steps Zenlytic recommends Customer take to address the Information Security Incident; and
3. the preparation of data protection impact assessments and, where applicable, carrying out consultations with any Supervisory Authority.

### 4.5 Legal Processing Requirements

If Zenlytic is required by Data Protection Requirements to process any Personal Data other than as set forth in this Addendum, Zenlytic shall inform Customer of this requirement in advance of any processing, unless Zenlytic is legally prohibited from informing Customer of such processing.

## 5. Audit; Certification

Customer may audit Zenlytic's compliance with this Addendum up to once per year and on such other occasions as may be required by Data Protection Requirements. Zenlytic will cooperate with the audit by providing Customer or Customer's Supervisory Authority with the information and assistance reasonably necessary to conduct the audit. Customer will reimburse Zenlytic for its reasonable expenses incurred to cooperate with such an audit. The audit must be conducted during regular business hours, subject to an agreed upon audit plan and Zenlytic's safety, security or other relevant policies, and may not unreasonably interfere with Zenlytic's business activities. Zenlytic shall not be required to breach any duties of confidentiality in connection with such audit, and Customer may use the audit reports only for the purposes of meeting Customer's regulatory audit requirements and/or confirming compliance with the requirements of this Addendum.

## 6. Data Transfers

### 6.1 General Transfer Provisions

Zenlytic is located in the United States, and may store and process Personal Data in the United States or anywhere Zenlytic or its subprocessors maintains facilities. Accordingly, Customer acknowledges that certain Restricted Transfers may be effected under this Addendum. The provisions of this Section 6 shall apply to any such Restricted Transfers (if and as applicable, having regard to the nature of those transfers and the application or otherwise of Chapter V of the EU GDPR and/or UK GDPR). The Standard Contractual Clauses referred to in this Section 6 shall only have effect if and to the extent permitted and required under the EU GDPR and/or UK GDPR to establish a valid basis under Chapter V of the EU GDPR and/or UK GDPR (if and as applicable) in respect of the transfer to Zenlytic of Personal Data.

   8. To the extent that Zenlytic effects a UK Restricted Transfer to a subprocessor, Zenlytic shall (and Customer hereby authorized Zenlytic to) enter into the UK Standard Contractual Clauses as agent for Customer (as "data exporter") with that subprocessor (as "data importer"). In respect of any such UK Restricted Transfer between Zenlytic and a subprocessor, Customer acknowledges and agrees that Zenlytic's obligation to enter into the UK Standard Contractual Clauses shall be satisfied by the inclusion of the details of the Personal Data in the general description of the "personal data" referred to in any existing or future UK Standard Contractual Clauses entered into by and between Zenlytic and that subprocessor.

### 6.4 Alternative Compliance Standards

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Standard Contractual Clauses (or obligations the same as those under the Standard Contractual Clauses) will not apply to the extent an alternative recognized compliance standard for the lawful transfer of European Personal Data outside the EEA or UK Personal Data outside the UK (e.g., binding corporate rules) applies to the transfer.

## 7. Term

This Addendum shall remain in effect as long as Zenlytic carries out Personal Data processing operations on behalf of Customer or until the termination of the Agreement (and all Personal Data has been returned or deleted in accordance with section 8 below).
