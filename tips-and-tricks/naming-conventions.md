# Naming Conventions

Clearly naming your metrics (measures) and dimensions is key for Zoë to perform well for you. If you have two revenue metrics defined as `Revenue first` and `Revenue second`, Zoë, like a human analyst, will have no idea which one to pick.

However, if you define those two values as `Gross revenue` and `Net revenue` Zoë will have no problem distinguishing between them and when to use one vs. the other. If an outside analyst could read all your metric definitions and understand which ones to use in the right cases, Zoë would also be able to.
