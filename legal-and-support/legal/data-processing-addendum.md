{% step %}
### Zenlytic's processor/subprocessor commitments

Zenlytic, in its capacity as a Processor or subprocessor of Personal Data, shall:

1. process Personal Data solely for the purposes of providing the Services as described in the Agreement (which shall encompass the processing authorized by Customer's instructions), and in compliance with the instructions received from Customer and the Agreement;
2. not sell any CA Personal Data or retain, use or disclose CA Personal Data outside of the direct business relationship between Zenlytic and Customer;
3. inform Customer promptly if, in Zenlytic's opinion, an instruction from Customer violates applicable Data Protection Requirements;
4. adopt and maintain appropriate security measures including organizational and technical measures, which will be at least as stringent as those set forth as Exhibit A attached hereto (the "Security Measures"), designed to maintain a level of security appropriate to the risks presented by processing the Personal Data, taking into account the state of the art, the costs of implementation and the nature, scope, context and purposes of processing as well as the risk of varying likelihood and severity for the rights and freedoms of natural persons;
5. grant access to Personal Data only to personnel who need such access for the scope of their job duties, and are subject to appropriate confidentiality arrangements;
6. if it intends to engage one or more third parties acting on its behalf ("subprocessor") to help it to satisfy its obligations in accordance with this Addendum or to delegate all or part of the processing activities to such subprocessors: (i) remain responsible, and liable, to Customer for the subprocessors' acts and omissions with regard to data protection; and (ii) enter into contractual arrangements with such subprocessors requiring them to provide a substantially similar level of data protection compliance and information security to that provided for herein. Subject to the requirements of this Section 4.1(6), Customer hereby generally authorizes the engagement of subprocessors. When any new subprocessor is engaged during the term of the Agreement, Zenlytic will promptly notify Customer of the engagement. If Customer objects to such engagement in a written notice to Zenlytic within 15 days of being informed thereof on reasonable grounds relating to the protection of Personal Data, Zenlytic and Customer will work together in good faith to find a mutually acceptable resolution to address such objection. If the parties are unable to reach a mutually acceptable resolution within a reasonable timeframe, Customer may, as its sole and exclusive remedy, terminate the Agreement for its convenience (without liability to Zenlytic) and cancel the Services by providing written notice to Zenlytic. If Customer does not object to Zenlytic's appointment of a subprocessor during the 15-day period referred to in this Section 4.1(6), Customer shall be deemed to have approved Zenlytic's engagement and ongoing use of that subprocessor.

In the event that a data subject sends such a request directly to Zenlytic, Zenlytic will direct the data subject to submit such request to Customer directly, and Customer shall be responsible for responding to such requests. Where relevant, Customer acknowledges and agrees, both generally and specifically for the purpose of Clause 10(a) of Module Three of the EU Standard Contractual Clauses, that there are no circumstances in which it would be appropriate for Zenlytic to notify any third-party controller of any data subject request and that any such notification shall be the Customer's responsibility.

3. the preparation of data protection impact assessments and, where applicable, carrying out consultations with any Supervisory Authority.

4.5. If Zenlytic is required by Data Protection Requirements to process any Personal Data other than as set forth in this Addendum, Zenlytic shall inform Customer of this requirement in advance of any processing, unless Zenlytic is legally prohibited from informing Customer of such processing.

Customer will reimburse Zenlytic for its reasonable expenses incurred to cooperate with such an audit. The audit must be conducted during regular business hours, subject to an agreed upon audit plan and Zenlytic's safety, security or other relevant policies, and may not unreasonably interfere with Zenlytic's business activities.

The provisions of this Section 6 shall apply to any such Restricted Transfers (if and as applicable, having regard to the nature of those transfers and the application or otherwise of Chapter V of the EU GDPR and/or UK GDPR). The Standard Contractual Clauses referred to in this Section 6 shall only have effect if and to the extent permitted and required under the EU GDPR and/or UK GDPR to establish a valid basis under Chapter V of the EU GDPR and/or UK GDPR (if and as applicable) in respect of the transfer to Zenlytic of Personal Data.

4. To the extent that Zenlytic effects a UK Restricted Transfer to a subprocessor, Zenlytic shall (and Customer hereby authorized Zenlytic to) enter into the UK Standard Contractual Clauses as agent for Customer (as "data exporter") with that subprocessor (as "data importer").
