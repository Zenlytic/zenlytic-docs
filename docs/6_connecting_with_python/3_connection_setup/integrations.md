# Integrations

The metrics layer (obviously) integrates with [Zenlytic's own data model](../../4_data_modeling/1_data_modeling.md) as a data model, [dbt Metrics](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/building-a-dbt-project/metrics) (example dbt [integration](https://github.com/Zenlytic/jaffle_shop)), and dbt's semantic layer with [Metricflow](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/build/sl-getting-started).

It integrates with BigQuery, Redshift, Postgres, Druid, DuckDB (MotherDuck), SQL Server, and Snowflake for data warehouses.
