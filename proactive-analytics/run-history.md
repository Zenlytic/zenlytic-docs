# Run History

The _Run_ _History_ tab provides a list of previous runs of the currently selected Proactive Agent. By clicking on a run on the left-hand side, the conversation preview on the right-hand side will change to show that previous run's conversation history.

## Reinforcing a previous run

The _Star_ icon button represents the option for marking a previous Proactive Agent run as an ideal response that should be used to guide future responses. Starring a previous run of the Proactive Agent is an important mechanism to increase the consistency of Zoe's response between runs. The starred conversation will only be added to Zoe's context when the Proactive Agent is run from a new chat, i.e. the starred conversation will be ignored when running the Proactive Agent from the Proactive Agent Builder. At this time only one conversation can be starred at a time.
